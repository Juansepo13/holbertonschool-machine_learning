## General
* What is a convolution?
* What is max pooling? average pooling?
* What is a kernel/filter?
* What is padding?
* What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
* What is a stride?
* What are channels?
* How to perform a convolution over an image
* How to perform max/average pooling over an image

## Resources

* Image Kernels
* Undrestanding Convolutional Layers
* A Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way
* What is max pooling in convolutional neural networks?
* Edge Detection Examples
* Padding
* Strided Convolutions
* Convolutions over Volumes
* Pooling Layers
* Implementing ‘SAME’ and ‘VALID’ padding of Tensorflow in Python
```NOTE: In this document, there is a mistake regarding valid padding. Floor rounding should be used for valid padding instead of ceiling```

### Definitions to skim:
Convolution
Kernel (image processing)

### References:
* numpy.pad
